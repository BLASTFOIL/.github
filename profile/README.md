# BLASTFOIL

Hey there! We are BLASTFOIL (_**B**ig, **L**ight, and **S**calable **T**echnology for **O**ptimized **A**irfoil **I**nvestigation and **L**earning_), a small team of students from Aerospace and Computer Engineering at the University of Vigo.

## What is BLASTFOIL?

Our goal is to develop a tool that allows the user to design and optimize airfoils for different applications. We want to make it as easy as possible for the user to get airfoil models, analyze and compare them, and even optimize them for a specific purpose.

## Development plan

Currently, we are in the first phase of the project, which consists of the development of multiple command-line tools that will be used to get and analyze airfoil models. The next step will be to develop a GUI that will allow the user to interact with the tools in a more intuitive way.
